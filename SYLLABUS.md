### Course Description

Digital media - like Instagram photos, TikTok stories, Google searches, Buzzfeed and Boing Boing articles, Reddit threads, and WhatsApp messages - combines to form the vast majority of the content most of us create and consume every day. Existing digital media and the digitized versions of the old media before it are available to more people than ever before, while even more digital content is created each day than in the whole of human history up to the creation of the internet. Protests, social justice movements, and political campaigns are won or lost through online organization and the dissemination of viral digital media. And this list, the list of influences digital media holds in our lives, still continues to grow and grow. In the vast interconnected global village of the internet, who are we in relationship to and how do we thoughtfully read digital media? And, even more, what skills are most useful to strengthen our careers and communities, and lead our own creative endeavors and social movements in this media landscape? These are some of the primary questions we will be exploring in this digital practices course.

* Our course explores digital media as an art form, bringing it together with design, cultural and technology studies, and into an interactive, collaborative class.
* Our course is oriented toward making, writing, building and identifying relevant skills for a digital media toolkit and historical and theoretical introductions to practices that will be useful for creative and critical thinkers working across disciplines.
* This course is required for BA in IDEAS, BA in Theatre and Performance, and BA in Theatre Design, Production and Technology. Extensive computer use (and internet access) required.

### Course Outcomes

* Students will demonstrate a basic understanding of how key ideas of digital media practices in design and the arts are materialized through current digital media creation tools and their underling social and technological systems.
* Students will demonstrate an understanding of digital media resources in design and the arts.
* Students will demonstrate an ability to use current creative digital media tools (purpose built or appropriated) and systems in design and the arts.
* Students will demonstrate a basic understanding of how digital media practices in design and the arts (including architectural, visual, environmental, theatrical, musical, and art historical) reflects and shapes technological and cultural conditions, including questions of community, personal narrative, privacy, and security.

### Assessment Methods

* Short projects, class readings, and class discussion will evaluate students’ understanding of how key ideas of digital media practices in design and arts disciplines are materialized through current digital tools and systems.
* Short projects will evaluate students’ understanding of digital media resources in design and arts disciplines.
* Short projects will evaluate the students’ ability to use current digital media tools and systems in design and arts disciplines.
* A website project will evaluate students’ ability to apply computer programming concepts.
* Assigned readings, videos to watch, audio to listen to, and weekly discussions will challenge students to think critically about how digital media practices in design and the arts shape technological and cultural conditions in relation to questions of community, personal narrative, privacy, and security.

### Course Content and Materials

Pre-recorded lectures, texts, articles, videos, audio clips, as well as additional resources like example files and tutorials, can be accessed on the course GitHub repository under the folder for the current week. You will be responsible for watching, reading, and listening to each week's materials, as their content will be explored further in class discussion and your weekly assignments.

### Git, GitHub

We will make extensive use of Git and GitHub to post writing responses, project files, and as the central hub for course materials. 

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a file management system used in software development that allows programmers to manage their projects as "repositories" or all-inclusive packages that can be managed and updated easily. [GitHub](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) is a web service that hosts these repositories. GitHub uses Git, but Git does not necessarily use GitHub.

A free GitHub account is required for this class.


### Assignments (100 possible points)

* Github Poetry Project: 10 pts
* Digital Header Project: 10 pts
* Typography Project: 10 pts
* Non-linear Narrative Project: 10 pts
* Final Portfolio Project: 20 pts
* Written Responses: 20 pts
* Discussion Participation: 20 pts

### Revision Policy

After project critiques, you will have the chance to revise your assignments using what you've learned in our discussion. Revised projects can be submitted directly to me by pushing the updated changes to our GitHub repository.

### Attendance, Participation, and Zoom Expectations

This is a four hour course, with one contact hour per week in the form of Thursday discussions. You should expect to read, watch, or listen to around 3 hours of required course materials per week, in addition to the time it will take to complete assignments. Attendance for all discussions is required. 

While a Zoom call doesn't look like a typical classroom, the same basic classroom courtesies apply.

* Keep your video on. Turning off your video is the same as leaving early, or not showing up.
* As much as you're able to, please keep your audio unmuted. Ensure you're in a quiet space where you can focus and be present in our discussions. If classmates are distracted by your background noise, you probably are, too.
* Don't meet with us from your bed, and please do not lay down during our discussions.
* Within reason, get up and move around to pace, stretch, and reenergize yourself if you want or need to. Don't feel like you have to stare into the camera the entire time.
* Consider [hiding your own video from yourself](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001077226-Hiding-or-showing-my-video-on-my-display#:~:text=Start%20or%20join%20a%20Zoom,see%20the%20video%20of%20you.) to minimize [Zoom fatigue](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue).
* Do complete all readings and be prepared to participate in discussions. This is a significant portion of your grade.
